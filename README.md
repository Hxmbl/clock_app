# clock_app

It's an app, it has a digital clock.

# What do I want to do with this app?

I basically want a tablet to turn into an Alexa Echo show. Right now, I'm just doing a clock, but maybe I could get blurred backgrounds, weather information, and more.

# Do I know what I'm doing?

No, help would be appreciated.
